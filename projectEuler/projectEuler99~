Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048  37 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382518061  519432525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
